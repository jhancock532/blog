I've rewritten the about section to be a bit more striking, and I've hooked up a Google Forms for comments. I've also added a mailing list service - it doesn't feel great importing code from other people, but that's what you get for convenience. Google Forms also takes rudimentary fingerprints of all the devices that use it, so it fits nicely into the discussion on the site.

Overall, the second half of development of this project was very rushed, but that is the nature of an MA with several other upcoming deadlines approaching. While it is tempting to make a perfect website and perfect pitch, I think I will have to be content with what my friends think of it - really cool - (or as one discord reviewer noted, "cool"). A creative web developer who has made some of the most heavily privacy invasive websites I've ever seen for Universal Music (I can't link to the website without written permission, as per their terms and conditions) liked the project on Twitter, so that is nice.

So in terms of a networked art piece, this is probably going to end up in a rather small network - butt it's good for a portfolio. I don't want to host an event for it as I don't really have the time. We'll see how well the piece runs on the day of the final presentation. I was able to run 16 devices comfortably together at 30fps on my desktop, on my phone it would run slightly faster. I think the important thing is, that you can see members of the network connnecting and look at all the stats of who has visited in the past. It's not quite the same as the IP address chatrooms of the past net art pieces, but it's its own space.

Yet another website to be explored in the interconnected network of the world wide web.
