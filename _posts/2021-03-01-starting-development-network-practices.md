Following the NPM installation tutorial at https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation

Reading about NPM packages at https://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html#h_J6hW/SmL/a

*When you run npm install without naming a package to install, NPM will install the dependencies listed in package.json*

*"^2.3.0" would mean that any version greater than or equal to 2.3.0 and less than 3.0.0 is allowed*

After reading about WebPack, now following the SnowPack tutorial https://www.snowpack.dev/tutorials/quick-start

Now following the more detailed tutorial - https://www.snowpack.dev/tutorials/getting-started

Adding fingerprint.js - it works fine, returns a mix of digits and letters for id - will update API to be compatible.
