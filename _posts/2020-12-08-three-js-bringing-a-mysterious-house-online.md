I&#8217;m a long time fan of [DearestHershel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJneOHw09N_K1eXmtEWSgBA), a Professor Layton fan meme channel. Watching the 2K subs special, I saw that Bob had used a 3D model of the room whilst creating the video. I wondered if I could convert that room into an online space &#8211; then I hit Bob up on Discord to ask for the assets. Here&#8217;s what I learned from two day project.

Creating scenes for the web is a pain. You have to reduce all the assets texture sizes and polygon counts, I did this using Blender.

  * Why would we use a 8MB texture for bookshelves?
  * We can duplicate instances of the sofa so we don&#8217;t need double the mesh data
  * I&#8217;ve reduced the size of the sofa texture in half, saved it as a jpeg, made it lighter
  * I&#8217;m limiting image file sizes to 100kb, 1024 by 1024 and shifting the jpeg compression quality to 60%.

  * The curtains are super big &#8211; used the decimate function, mode planar, to reduce the triangle count down to 1700 (from 6500) without large drop in quality.
  * Ok &#8211; exported object file looking super big at 16MB üôÅ
  * With default compression settings, 15MB
  * Maybe everything could be scaled down? Less large floats to worry about?
  * Chosing to export images as jpeg cut the file size down to 4.5MB! That&#8217;s like the size of a normal bloated webpage!

  * It is incredibly disorientating to see another mouse move across your webpage. Like seriously weird, even if it&#8217;s in a background video that&#8217;s projected onto a 3D scene.
  * Adding lots of small details really fills out a scene.
  * I can make textures reflective! Not sure that it will export to GLB though&#8230; it kinda did? lights reflect, but not the environment. It kinda looks like a mirror, maybe.
  * Textures still look ok at 512 by 512, depends on size of file I guess.
  * I reused the door texture for the table. It looks fine.

  * This is good practice for playing with different material effects. GLB files have to use roughness and metallic effects, I can&#8217;t use specular.
  * For minor details, don&#8217;t import image textures, just use materials.
  * Metalic textures are awesome!
  * Small props added, file size now 17MB &#8211; scalling the file down actually increased the size of the file by 5 kb. I&#8217;ve applied compression, not sure how this will effect how the model displays.

This is a slap dash project, so this is slap dash documentation. Time doesn&#8217;t exist to a compiler.

  * <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/DRACOLoader">https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/DRACOLoader</a> &#8211; Draco compression looks cool, giving it a go.
  * And&#8230; I only saved a couple hundred kb in comparision to the compression offered by Blender. Ah well.

This site only works on Firefox, for some reason glitches occur on other people&#8217;s PC&#8217;s. Ah well, mission accomplished.
