I have been minimising the content on my portfolio site to avoid adding to the cognitive load of the site visitors.

I am using a similar approach to writing this blog post. The noise of the web 2.0 is a large influence in my work.

Accordingly, I am mindfully adding social media icons at the bottom of my site, in full compliance with their brand guidelines.

YouTube requires a brand request submission for any use of the YouTube icon. I submitted mine below, with the following mockup attached.

After several days, they approved my request. I then responded to the email, enquiring as to why the [YouTube Brand Resources page](https://www.youtube.com/about/brand-resources/#logos-icons-colors) didn't follow the Facebook brand guidelines.

See the outdated Facebook logo below, also note how the Twitter icon doesn't follow Twitter's brand colours.

Sadly, YouTube has not yet responded to my request for comment.

I appreciate Instagram's brand guidelines surrounding the use of their logo the best; they allow you to recolor the logo when it's used as part of a series of social media icons.
