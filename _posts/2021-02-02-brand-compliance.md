I have been minimising my portfolio site content to avoid adding to the cognitive load of site visitors.

I am using a similar approach to write this blog post. I have decided to oppose noise of the web 2.0 in all aspects of my practice, hence the new blog design.

I am adding social media icons at the bottom of my portfolio website in full compliance of their respective brand guidelines.

YouTube requires a brand request submission for any use of the YouTube icon. I submitted mine as follows.

After several days, they approved my request. I then responded to the email, enquiring as to why the [YouTube Brand Resources page](https://www.youtube.com/about/brand-resources/#logos-icons-colors) didn't follow the Facebook brand guidelines.

YouTube uses an outdated Facebook icon throughout their site, something that Facebook strictly prohibits.

Sadly, YouTube has not yet responded to my request for comment.

I appreciate Instagram's brand guidelines the best out of all social media; they allow you to recolor the logo when it's used as one of a series of social media icons.
