So visitors are going onto the website, then what?

We're taking fingerprints of all the visitors.

This is basically a crime scene, so what crime has been committed?

An invasion of visitors privacy: the collection of information without visitors permission.

===

When you visit a website that uses fingerprinting code, your fingerprint reveals information about you to the site owner and other interested third parties, often without your knowledge.

"Your Digital Fingerprint"

... is made from information your device shares publicly when you visit a website. This information is often specific enough to track individuals across the web.

In this website, your fingerprint is hashed and shared publicly through a 3D avatar representation. If any other visitors are accessing the site simulatenously, you will see their device fingerprints reflected in their avatars. 

Only the hash of the fingerprint is shared with other participants; this demonstrates the unique variety of our digital fingerprint presence, whilst protecting individual details.

If there are no other avatars online, several ghost avatars of past site visitors will appear. Hover over these ghosts to see when they visited the site. Many websites have ghost visitors like these, hidden away in server request logs.

A crime scene isn't quite right, if only there was another angle for this project...
