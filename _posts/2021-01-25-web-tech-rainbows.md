After testing my gallery website with visitors, they often missed the `Click to visit gallery` button. This is perhaps because they've tested this site previously and expect to be able to walk around the gallery immediately, as they are used to. However, I acknowledge that the button is rather obscure. To remedy this, I gave the button a rainbow background, made its text larger and gave it a fancy spiky border.

The technique for implementing the rainbow background was inspired by [Robin Sloan's website](https://www.robinsloan.com/), I reused the spikey border hover effect from a [previous project](https://jhancock532.github.io/link-hover-effects/). It's fun to add these offbeat design elements into the website, it gives the site a bit more character. 

On reflection, the button starts to be a bit too distracting; I now only show the rainbow effect on hover. And I'll reduce the font size a bit!

For the rest of the portfolio site, I want to keep things uncluttered and simple. This saves development time and builds my brand image. I like the idea of reducing online noise if possible (as well as offering the alternative online experience that is a 3D gallery).

Another idea that resonated with me this week was that 
> "(Internet art) is art because it incorperates the internet with an original idea and authentic message, it changes the perpsective from which we see usual things such as a browser page or social networks... this is what artists alway do: they experiment with reality and question whats taken for granted."
