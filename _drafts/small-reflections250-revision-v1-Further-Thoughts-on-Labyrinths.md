The steps we take from where we are to where we want to be. An ideal goal, obscured, eventual, not directly accessible.

We run away from ourselves in a thousand different ways. We lose our souls a thousand times each day. But we are always attached to reality, no matter how detached we distract ourselves away.

&#8220;Attached to reality&#8221; implies a duality. For one moment, please focus on this spiraling pattern. Follow the start of the labyrinth to the center with your finger.<figure class="wp-block-image">

## Dreaming

I&#8217;ve dreamed of spending three days in a dream, only to fight my way to consciousness through the fluttering of my eyelids.

I&#8217;ve dreamed that I was awake, I further convinced myself of wakefulness by dreaming I found everything I percieved as being realistic.

I&#8217;ve dreamed of not being able to discern the difference between dreams and reality.

And somewhere, by The Circular Ruins, a man lies dreaming.

## Perception

There is often more noticed after mindfulness related meditation practices. Clear vision. Noted thoughts. Tender feelings.

Perhaps it&#8217;s not about perception. Instead, existence. Being full, close, present.

## The Internet

Devised by men, destined to be deciphered. 

How many hours of YouTube videos do you need to watch to understand? How long do you need to contemplate afterwards for understanding to arise? What is there to understand? What lies between the pixels, the frames, the opinions? The gap of discomfort.

## Control

I don&#8217;t want to feel this way.

I don&#8217;t want to feel this way.

I don&#8217;t want to feel this way.
