What is my research question for Labyrinth?

What would an labyrinth website look like? Can we create a web experience in which the user becomes disorientated going from webpage to webpage?

Generally a webpage has many anchors to the rest of the internet in the form of links. What if we give the user no access to links? What if we can only progress through the labyrinth step by step, and any attempts to access later pages early on are denied? Can we get the user to backtrack, revisit patterns and motifs?<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

The theme for the labyrinth is duality.

What is the focus of this website? I&#8217;ll have to write 500 words about it. Let&#8217;s say a blog post every week / if not more. What about reading and analogous inspiration? Let&#8217;s say two hours reading another piece of work outside the must read pieces related to what I&#8217;m interested in. It would be really nice to block out a routine so I have a pattern that can balance all these things.
